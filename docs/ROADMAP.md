# Catz-Embroidery — roadmap

**A phase is done when its exit criteria pass, not when its code is written.** Each phase below
names what stops it from being called done, and those are gates that run — not a checklist somebody
walks.

**Status: the phase table below is the single source of truth — every row is `done` or `planned`,
and a row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.**

## Phase table

| Phase | Delivers | Exit criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Scaffold: workspace, crates (emb-data/model/draw + 4 apps as empty skeletons), gates (arch.rs, memory.rs), docs | `cargo test --workspace` green incl. the gate tests; every crate carries `forbid(unsafe_code)`; matrix.toml rows match the manifests | **done** |
| M1 | emb-data: PES read+write, DST write, SVG write | round-trip and byte-compare against Java-generated fixtures; structured errors; no model dependency; each format has a named consumer (converter: PES/SVG, editor: DST) | **done** |
| M2 | emb-model: stitch model + hatch/satin/trace/TSP | algorithms tolerance-compare (0.001 mm, D002) with Java model outputs on shared fixtures | planned |
| M3 | emb-draw + viewer | viewer renders a real design from emb-model via the draw list | planned |
| M4 | editor | stitch editing on real files; save via emb-data | planned |
| M5 | converter (UI) + infinite-draw + launcher hub + packaging | both apps work on real files; hub launches apps; exe builds | planned |

> Rows are re-ordered and their exit criteria tightened by the architecture ruling
> (D001) and by what the code finds. A row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.

> **M2 progress (2026-08-16, slice 3b):** `hatchParallelComplex` (holes via the
> even-odd rule) — the last vector-pure algorithm. Slices 1-3a delivered the
> model core, geometry, resample, hatch_parallel, TSP, trace,
> hatchParallelRaster, CROSS and isolines. **Deferred by D003 (Java2D
> rasterization):** PERLIN, strokes, spirals v2-v4, offset/inset, hatchInset,
> satin — plus `offsetPolygon`'s random fragment culling (measured,
> docs/LESSONS.md). They enter with the converter (M5).
>
> **Named exceptions (pin 3):** `resample(randomize != 0)` refuses with an error —
> no consumer uses it (RESAMPLE_NOISE = 0 everywhere); queued until a consumer asks.

## How to resume

Verify before believing any of this file. A green gate run means the repository is as the last
session left it:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace   # expect: all green, incl. the gate tests
```

Where the next session starts: the first `planned` row of the phase table.
