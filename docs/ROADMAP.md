# Catz-Embroidery — roadmap

**A phase is done when its exit criteria pass, not when its code is written.** Each phase below
names what stops it from being called done, and those are gates that run — not a checklist somebody
walks.

**Status: the phase table below is the single source of truth — every row is `done` or `planned`,
and a row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.**

## Phase table

| Phase | Delivers | Exit criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Scaffold: workspace, crates (emb-data/model/draw + 4 apps as empty skeletons), gates (arch.rs, memory.rs), docs | `cargo test --workspace` green incl. the gate tests; every crate carries `forbid(unsafe_code)`; matrix.toml rows match the manifests | **done** |
| M1 | emb-data: DST/PES/CSV read + write | parsers round-trip on real files; structured errors; no model dependency | planned |
| M2 | emb-model: stitch model + hatch/satin/trace/TSP | algorithms byte-compare with Java model outputs on shared fixtures | planned |
| M3 | emb-draw + viewer | viewer renders a real design from emb-model via the draw list | planned |
| M4 | editor | stitch editing on real files; save via emb-data | planned |
| M5 | converter (UI) + infinite-draw + launcher hub + packaging | both apps work on real files; hub launches apps; exe builds | planned |

> Rows are re-ordered and their exit criteria tightened by the architecture ruling
> (D001) and by what the code finds. A row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.

## How to resume

Verify before believing any of this file. A green gate run means the repository is as the last
session left it:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace   # expect: all green, incl. the gate tests
```

Where the next session starts: the first `planned` row of the phase table.
