# Catz-Embroidery — roadmap

**A phase is done when its exit criteria pass, not when its code is written.** Each phase below
names what stops it from being called done, and those are gates that run — not a checklist somebody
walks.

**Status: the phase table below is the single source of truth — every row is `done` or `planned`,
and a row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.**

## Phase table

| Phase | Delivers | Exit criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Scaffold: workspace, crates (emb-data/model/draw + 4 apps as empty skeletons), gates (arch.rs, memory.rs), docs | `cargo test --workspace` green incl. the gate tests; every crate carries `forbid(unsafe_code)`; matrix.toml rows match the manifests | **done** |
| M1 | emb-data: PES read+write, DST write, SVG write | round-trip and byte-compare against Java-generated fixtures; structured errors; no model dependency; each format has a named consumer (converter: PES/SVG, editor: DST) | **done** |
| M2 | emb-model: stitch model + hatch/satin/trace/TSP | algorithms tolerance-compare (0.001 mm, D002) with Java model outputs on shared fixtures | **done** (see D003 deferrals below) |
| M3 | emb-draw + viewer | viewer renders a real design from emb-model via the draw list | **in progress** (emb-draw done + viewer first slice, see wrap) |
| M4 | editor | stitch editing on real files; save via emb-data | **done** (user acceptance 2026-08-16; named exceptions below) |
| M5 | converter (UI) + infinite-draw + launcher hub + packaging | both apps work on real files; hub launches apps; exe builds | planned |

> Rows are re-ordered and their exit criteria tightened by the architecture ruling
> (D001) and by what the code finds. A row is `done` only when its exit criteria run green.

> **M2 is done with named deferrals (D003):** every vector-pure algorithm is
> ported and tolerance-compared against headless Java fixtures — model core,
> geometry, resample, hatch_parallel, hatchParallelComplex, TSP, trace
> (findContours + approxPolyDP), hatchParallelRaster + CROSS, isolines.
> Deferred to the converter phase (M5): PERLIN, strokes, spirals v2-v4,
> offset/inset, hatchInset, satin — each renders through `app.createGraphics`
> (Java2D rasterization) and/or `app.random` (measured in docs/LESSONS.md and
> ruled in docs/decisions/D003.md).
>
> **Named exceptions (pin 3):** `resample(randomize != 0)` refuses with an error —
> no consumer uses it (RESAMPLE_NOISE = 0 everywhere); queued until a consumer asks.
>
> **M4 is done with named exceptions (the M4 ruling + D003):** the editor
> stitches only visible layers' PLY elements via the vector
> `hatch_parallel` (PARALLEL mode only). LIN elements (stroke path),
> TXT elements (font rasteriser), CONCENTRIC hatch (hatchInset) and the
> layer stroke settings + cull toggle all enter with their consumers (M5,
> ruled in D003). The canvas preview shows the stitched design through
> `emb_draw::DrawList`, cached on a dirty flag (the Java's `needsUpdate`).

## How to resume

Verify before believing any of this file. A green gate run means the repository is as the last
session left it:

```powershell
cargo test --workspace   # expect: all green, incl. the gate tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo fmt --check
```

### Next-session strategy (wrap 2026-08-16, late — M4 accepted)

State: **M0, M1, M2, M4 done** (deferrals named below); M3 code done, its
visual acceptance pending (see below). Branch `rs-greenfield`. Working tree
clean, gates green.

M4 is **done, user acceptance approved 2026-08-16** (draw a polygon → save
PES → viewer reads it back). The editor: layers/elements + undo/redo
(AddElement/RemoveElement/RemovePoint, Ctrl+Z/Y), the 7 tools, edit-mode point
handles, stitched canvas preview via the shared draw list, save to
PES/DST/SVG centred on the hoop, title stem truncated to 8.

Next: **M5 — converter (UI) + infinite-draw + launcher + packaging**. First
slice candidates, in the Java suite's own order:

1. **The converter app** (the big one): image → PES/SVG/DST with the 5 hatch
   modes, image drag-drop/clipboard, preview, mm export settings, multicolor.
   Opens the D003 deferral question: PERLIN, strokes, spirals, offset/inset,
   hatchInset, satin render through Java2D — a ruling must say how they are
   compared (raster-level? re-evaluation?) before any is claimed ported.
2. **emb-launcher** (thin egui menu, no model knowledge — matrix row
   `allow = []`), then infinite-draw.
3. **Packaging**: exe builds.

Still pending from M3: **manual acceptance in the viewer** — open test.pes and
compare with ThreadsES (the remaining acceptance step before M3's row is
`done`).

### M3 acceptance bugs found on test.pes (2026-08-16, unknown-provenance file)

Reported by the user after comparing against **ThreadsES** (Ink/Stitch could not
be installed). All three turned out to have ONE cause, fixed and regression-
tested (see below) — verify visually before claiming acceptance.

1. ~~XY projection is wrong: the PES renders in the wrong orientation, and the
   motif is not inside the drawn hoop.~~ **FIXED 2026-08-16.** The reader had
   two bugs, both in `emb-data/src/pes.rs` and both measured against
   pyembroidery (the Ink/Stitch PES engine, installed as a reference):
   - **Long-form records are not always 4 bytes.** The Brother grammar flags
     each axis word independently: a byte with bit 7 opens a 12-bit value over
     2 bytes, otherwise it is a 7-bit delta on its own. A record is 2, 3 or
     4 bytes. test.pes's writer (Ticetac) emits 3-byte records (a dy word
     without the 0x80 flag); a reader that forces 4 bytes shifts the stream
     and invents phantom points — the characters' paws appeared at x ≈ -2500,
     140 mm left of the motif, and the x span came out 2.1× too wide.
   - **The offset words are the design origin.** `0x9000 | -left`: test.pes's
     `0x9480 0x90A4` decode to origin (1152, 164) — with the deltas accumulated
     from there, the design fills the declared bounds exactly (0..1234 ×
     0..900), instead of sitting ~115 mm left of the canvas (the drawn hoop
     floated to the right of the characters).
   Both fixed + regression-tested: `pes_third_party_offsets_and_three_byte_
   records` on the committed `fixtures/test.pes` (31077 points, bounds filled
   exactly, no point outside the canvas). The old reading spanned x -2554..74.
   ThreadsES's 31083 count = our 31077 + the 6 colour-change STOP stitches the
   reference emits.
2. ~~Bug 2~~ — user-reported as caused by 1 or 3; not an independent bug.
3. ~~Two "ears" of the motif land in the wrong place~~ — **FIXED by 1**: the
   "ears" were the phantom paws, an artifact of the 4-byte-long misparse. The
   CSewSeg section of test.pes (the design as authored, centred on the hoop)
   confirmed the paws belong with the characters, sticking slightly out of the
   frame.

### Deferred by D003 (reopened at M5, converter in front)

PERLIN, strokePolyNormal/Tangent, hatchSpiral_v2-v4, offsetPolygon/inset,
hatchInset, satin — each renders through `app.createGraphics` (Java2D) and/or
`app.random`. Do NOT claim any of them ported until a ruling says how they are
compared.

### Named exceptions (pin 3)

- `resample(randomize != 0)` refuses with an error — no consumer uses it.
